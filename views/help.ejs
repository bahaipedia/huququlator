        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq1">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq1')">What is Ḥuqúqu’lláh?</h2>
            <div class="faq-content expanded">
                <p>Ḥuqúqu’lláh is a voluntary tax on wealth that applies to members of the Bahá’í faith who meet certain requirements. Bahá’u’lláh writes 
                "Should anyone acquire one hundred mithqáls of gold, nineteen mithqáls thereof are God’s and to be rendered unto Him, the Fashioner of earth 
                and heaven."<a href="https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/bahaullah/kitab-i-aqdas/6#443108496" target="_blank" class="note-link">Kitáb-i-Aqdas</a></p>
                <p>For a general overview, view the <a href="https://bahaipedia.org/%E1%B8%A4uq%C3%BAqu%E2%80%99ll%C3%A1h#External_links" target="_blank">Bahaipedia</a> article.

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq2">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq2')">Excess wealth</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Enter the sum of all wealth and possessions you own, unless they are exempt.</p>
                <p>"The basic sum on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable is nineteen mithqáls of gold. In other words, when money to the value of this sum hath been acquired, 
                a payment of Ḥuqúq falleth due. Likewise Ḥuqúq is payable when the value, not the number, of other forms of property reacheth 
                the prescribed amount... The Primal Point hath directed that Ḥuqúqu’lláh must be paid on the value of whatsoever one 
                possesseth; yet, in this Most Mighty Dispensation, We have exempted the household furnishings, that is such furnishings as are needed, and the residence itself."</p>
                <p>Concerning the deduction of expenses. "As to the Ḥuqúq, it is payable on whatever is left over after deducting one’s yearly expenses. However, any money or 
                possession which is necessary in producing income for one’s subsistence, and on which Ḥuqúq hath once been paid, is exempt from Ḥuqúq."</p>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq3">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq3')">Unnecessary expenditures</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>For the purpose of this calculator, this section is intended to allow one to account for non-exempt possessions. "Ḥuqúq is applied on everything one 
                possesseth. However, if a person hath paid the Ḥuqúq on a certain property, and the income from that property is equal to his needs, no Ḥuqúq is payable 
                by that person. Ḥuqúq is not payable on agricultural tools and equipment, and on animals used in ploughing the land, to the extent that these are necessary."</p>
                <p>In other words if you purchased something subject to Ḥuqúqu’lláh ('unnecessary'), you can sum their value and list them in this section.</p>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq4">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq4')">Wealth Ḥuqúq has already been paid on</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>If you have already paid Ḥuqúqu’lláh on some portion of your wealth or possessions, you never need to pay it again for that portion.
                Additionally, if there is a loss subsequently recoevered, Ḥuqúqu’lláh is not payable on that "increase". Therefore, it is necessary to know the total amount
                of wealth on which you have previously paid Ḥuqúqu’lláh. This figure is not what you paid to Ḥuqúqu’lláh, but the wealth represented by those payements. If you only
                know the payments you have made in the past, sum them and multiply the total by (100/19) which will give you the total wealth on which you have paid Ḥuqúqu’lláh.</p>

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq5">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq5')">Value of 19 Mithqáls of gold</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>A Mithqál is a unit of weight. 19 mithqáls is equal to 69.192 grammes or 2.22456 troy ounces. We use an external source
                to get the value of one troy ounce of gold and multiple it by 2.22456.</p>

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq6">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq6')">Payment due on the following units of Ḥuqúq</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>"Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable as soon as a person’s assessable possessions reach or exceed the value of 19 mithqáls of 
                gold."</p>
                <p>The amounts you enetered as excess wealth and unncessay expenses are added together. The amount of wealth on which
                you have previously paid Ḥuqúqu’lláh is deducted from that total, then divided by the figure listed in "Today's 
                value of 19 Mithqáls of gold" and rounded down to give you a figure in whole units of Ḥuqúq. This figure represents the number
                of units of Ḥuqúq (one unit being equal to 19 Mithqáls of gold) you are required to pay on.</p>

        <!-- Question 7 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq7">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq7')">The amount of wealth you are paying Ḥuqúq on today</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Payment is only due on full units of Ḥuqúq (where one full unit is 19 Mithqáls of gold, the value of which is shown in the calculator).
                When your total wealth subjeqct to Ḥuqúqu’lláh is divided by today's value of 19 Mithqáls of gold that figure is rounded down to get the wealth
                you need to pay Ḥuqúqu’lláh on today. Save this figure for the future to ensure you don't pay Ḥuqúqu’lláh on the same wealth twice.</p>

            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Ḥuqúqu’lláh is a 19% tax on ones excess wealth. We multiply the amount of your excess wealth by 19% to calculate this figure.</p>
