        <div class="faq-item" id="faq1">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq1')">What is Ḥuqúqu’lláh?</h2>
            <div class="faq-content expanded">
                <p>Ḥuqúqu’lláh is a voluntary tax on wealth that applies to members of the Bahá’í faith who meet certain requirements. Bahá’u’lláh writes 
                "Should anyone acquire one hundred mithqáls of gold, nineteen mithqáls thereof are God’s and to be rendered unto Him, the Fashioner of earth 
                and heaven."<a href="https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/bahaullah/kitab-i-aqdas/6#443108496" target="_blank" class="note-link">Kitáb-i-Aqdas</a></p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq2">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq2')">Excess wealth</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>"The basic sum on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable is nineteen mithqáls of gold. In other words, when money to the value of this sum hath been acquired, 
                a payment of Ḥuqúq falleth due. Likewise Ḥuqúq is payable when the value, not the number, of other forms of property reacheth 
                the prescribed amount... The Primal Point hath directed that Ḥuqúqu’lláh must be paid on the value of whatsoever one 
                possesseth; yet, in this Most Mighty Dispensation, We have exempted the household furnishings, that is such furnishings as are needed, and the residence itself."</p>
                <p>Concerning the deduction of expenses. "As to the Ḥuqúq, it is payable on whatever is left over after deducting one’s yearly expenses. However, any money or 
                possession which is necessary in producing income for one’s subsistence, and on which Ḥuqúq hath once been paid, is exempt from Ḥuqúq."</p>
                <p>Enter the sum of all wealth and possessions you own, unless they are exempt.</p>

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq3">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq3')">Unnecessary expenditures</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>For the purpose of this calculator, this section is intended to allow one to account for non-exempt possessions. "Ḥuqúq is applied on everything one 
                possesseth. However, if a person hath paid the Ḥuqúq on a certain property, and the income from that property is equal to his needs, no Ḥuqúq is payable 
                by that person. Ḥuqúq is not payable on agricultural tools and equipment, and on animals used in ploughing the land, to the extent that these are necessary."</p>
                <p>In other words if you purchased something subject to Ḥuqúqu’lláh ('unnecessary'), you can sum the value of those items and list them in this section.</p>

        <!-- Question 4 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq4">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq4')">Wealth Ḥuqúq has already been paid on</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>If you have already paid Ḥuqúqu’lláh on some portion of your wealth or possessions, you never need to pay it again for that portion.
                Additionally, if there is a loss subsequently recoevered, Ḥuqúqu’lláh is not payable on that "increase". Therefore, it is necessary to know the total amount
                of your previous payments to Ḥuqúqu’lláh. This figure is not what you paid, but the wealth represented by those payements. If you only
                know the payments you have made in the past, sum them and multiply the total by (100/19) which will give you the total wealth on which you have paid Ḥuqúqu’lláh.</p>
                <p>Enter the sum of all wealth and possessinons you have ever paid Ḥuqúqu’lláh on.</p>

        <!-- Question 5 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq5">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq5')">When is Ḥuqúqu’lláh payable?</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Ḥuqúqu’lláh becomes payable when a Bahá’í acquires and retains wealth exceeding the necessary expenditures. Once the wealth reaches or exceeds the prescribed threshold, the obligation applies.</p>
                <p>The threshold for Ḥuqúqu’lláh is traditionally calculated in terms of 19 mithqáls of gold.</p>

        <!-- Question 6 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq6">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq6')">How is 19% calculated?</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>The 19% calculation applies to the portion of wealth that exceeds the threshold after deducting necessary expenditures. This percentage is derived from the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh and represents an act of devotion.</p>
                <p>For detailed instructions, consult the <a href="https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/codification-law-huququllah/codification-law-huququllah.xhtml" target="_blank" class="note-link">Codification of the Law of Ḥuqúqu’lláh</a>.</p>

            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq7')">Who can receive payments for Ḥuqúqu’lláh?</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Payments for Ḥuqúqu’lláh are made to authorized Bahá’í institutions or representatives appointed by the Universal House of Justice. These funds are used to further the work of the Faith and support its institutions.</p>
                <p>Contact your Local Spiritual Assembly for guidance on authorized representatives.</p>

        <!-- Question 8 -->
        <div class="faq-item" id="faq8">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq8')">Are gifts or inheritances included?</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Yes, gifts and inheritances are included in the calculation of wealth subject to Ḥuqúqu’lláh. However, certain exceptions may apply depending on the circumstances and the nature of the assets.</p>
                <p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/compilations/codification-law-huququllah/codification-law-huququllah.xhtml" target="_blank" class="note-link">Codification of the Law of Ḥuqúqu’lláh</a> for detailed guidance.</p>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq9">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq9')">Can Ḥuqúqu’lláh be paid in installments?</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Yes, Ḥuqúqu’lláh can be paid in installments if the individual is unable to pay the full amount at once. This flexibility ensures that fulfilling this obligation is not a hardship.</p>
                <p>Consult with your Local Spiritual Assembly or an authorized representative for specific arrangements.</p>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq10">
            <h2 onclick="toggleFaq('faq10')">What is the spiritual significance of Ḥuqúqu’lláh?</h2>
            <div class="faq-content">
                <p>Ḥuqúqu’lláh is not only a material obligation but also a spiritual act of devotion. It fosters detachment from material possessions and strengthens one’s connection with God.</p>
                <p>Bahá’u’lláh states: "Render thou thanks unto the Almighty for having graciously aided thee to fulfill that which is the highest aspiration of every true believer."</p>
